This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is a small todo app I worked on for a few hours as a challenge.

The first goal: manage state using only useReducer hook.

The second one: play around with [NIVO](https://nivo.rocks/) data components (Nivo provides a rich set of dataviz components built on top of d3 and Reactjs libraries).

## Install dependencies
#### `yarn install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
